<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">An easy to use and reliable script/bot to automatically register subject from DTU portal in background</p>
<hr />

## The problem (Outline)

DTU has a portal hosted on LSAcademia, and every semester students have to register their subjects. The portal is on first come first serve basis, but due to high traffic, the portal hardly works wasting a lot of time for students to register their subjects. Even despite that, not everyone gets the required subjects. And there is a lot trading of subjects going on, the one who are able to access the portal block subjects and later demand for other subjects or at times money.

## This solution

This LSAttacked (script) offer a simple yet reliable and easy solution to register subjects from the portal without have to even open the portal once. Just setup the LSAttacked (script) before the registration begins. Add in your credentials and the subjects codes that you need to register and let the LSAttacked (script) run in background.
